# Investigating the Most Effective Machine Learning Algorithm for Detecting Pneumonia in Chest X-Ray Scans
- Pneumonia is a serious infection which affects the lungs. Pneumonia can be detected through x-ray scans using machine learning algorithms, however, there are many machine learning algorithms which can be used in this situation. So, the big question is: which machine learning algorithm is the most efficient for detecting pneumonia in chest x-ray scans?
